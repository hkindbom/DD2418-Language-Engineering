# DD2418-Language Engineering
Assignments from the master course in language engineering on KTH, spring 2020

The assignments include both theoretical and coding problems 

### Tools
**Python 3**
- Numpy
- PyTorch
- NLTK
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Word2Vec


## Assignment 1
Working with syntax- and dependency trees. Note that only the methods valid_moves, 
move and compute_correct_move in DepParser skeleton were modified by me.

## Assignment 2
Working with conditional probabilities to build, train 
and evaluate a language model, which can generate text. A logistic
regression model for named entity recognition was
also implemented with stochastic gradient descent, 
batch gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent.

## Assignment 3
Working with two types of word embeddings: Random indexing
and Word2Vec. Both models were built and trained from
scratch. They were tested by using them to find the k
nearest neighbours. Code for visualizing the 
high-dimensional word embeddings using dimensionality 
reduction techniques (PCA and SVD) was also written.

## Assignment 4
Implemented the forward pass in Gated Recurrent Unit 
(GRU) networks. GRUs are used to capture long-term dependencies
in natural language.
